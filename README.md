# Store-Management-System
This is my course project for OOP in Java, I worked on it as a group project with my colleagues.

# About the project
A store management system provides an easy way to track the products as well as purchase information. It also records the products currently available in the store. There are two users, employees one of them is manager and customers. All of them can perform some operations in the system.
